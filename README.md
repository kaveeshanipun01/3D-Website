# MCODE - E-BOT for Developers

MCODE is a web application designed for developers looking to integrate 3D models into their websites. The platform adds smooth animations and creates responsive 3D web designs, ensuring a visually appealing experience across all devices.

## Project Structure

### HTML Overview

The HTML file establishes the structure for the webpage:

- **Doctype and Language**: The document type is set to HTML5, and the language is specified as English.
- **Meta Tags**: 
  - The character set is UTF-8, ensuring support for various characters.
  - The viewport is set for responsive design, allowing proper scaling on mobile devices.

- **Links to Stylesheets**: The page links to a custom `style.css` for styling and an external library for AOS (Animate On Scroll) animations.

- **Body Content**:
  - A background image with a gradient is set and overlaid with a blur effect.
  - The main structure includes a header with a title (`MCODE`), navigation links (for COMPANY, FEATURES, RESOURCES, and DOCS), and a signing button.
  - The main content features a dynamic tag box, a headline welcoming developers, a description of services, and actionable buttons for documentation and getting started.
  - A 3D model viewer is included to showcase the offerings of the platform.

### CSS Overview

The accompanying CSS styles the webpage to enhance its visual appeal and ensure usability:

- **Global Styles**:
  - **Reset Styles**: All elements have their margin and padding set to zero, and the box-sizing model is set to `border-box` for a consistent layout.
  
- **Body Styles**:
  - A system font stack is defined for broad compatibility. The background is set to black with light grey text, and line-height is adjusted for clarity.

- **Effects**:
  - **Gradient and Blur**: The background image has reduced opacity, and a blur effect is added to create a soft, diffused layer behind the main content, enhancing visibility and aesthetics.

- **Container and Layout**:
  - A `.container` class adds responsive padding and centering, ensuring content is well-structured.
  
- **Header Styles**:
  - The header uses flexbox for responsive alignment of the logo and navigation items. Navigation links have hover effects to enhance usability.

- **Main Content Styling**:
  - The content is centered with appropriate margins and z-indices to ensure it appears above other elements. Animation effects are applied to various components, creating a polished, interactive experience.

- **Buttons**:
  - Various buttons (signing and navigation) are styled with padding, background colors, and hover effects to make them more inviting and interactive.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Media queries adjust the layout for tablet and mobile screens, modifying paddings, font sizes, and hiding certain navigation elements to maintain usability across devices.
